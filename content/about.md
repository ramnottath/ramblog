## About me

A senior technology architect who started the career on Mainframes and expended his horizons to Traditional, NoSQL, NewSQL databases and BigData technologies and Data Science. It might be just a coincidence that both my parents are teachers and I started my career with Infosys back in 2004 as an educator. For the last one and half decade I have been working on several data migration / analytics initiatives across financial clients. 

I'm married to Saritha Ramkumar who works as a Data Scientist in American Airlines. We have a 3 year old son Murali Krishna who keeps us busy all the time.
