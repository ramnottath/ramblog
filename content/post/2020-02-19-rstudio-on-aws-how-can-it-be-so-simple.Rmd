# Rstudio on AWS

In this post, we'll look at the steps involved in bringing up Rstudio in AWS environment based on Amazon Machine Images (AMI).

You won't believe, it is so simple. First, login to AWS Management Console. Click on EC2 Service. On the left pane, select AMIs. You can search for pre built images here. Search for 'rstudio'. You'll see something very similar to the below image.

After selecting the AMI, you may want to select the instance type as t2.micro since it is 'Free Tier Eligible'.

Select the image and click launch. Don't his 'Review and Launch' button yet. Keep going with default option until you see 'Configure Security Group'. Add another rule for 'HTTP' with Source as 'Anywhere'. Review and Launch.

Once the instance is launched, go to the instance and get 'Public Ip' and 'Instance ID'. You are all set to launch your Rstudio. 

Use the IP in a browser. Login with user name as 'rstudio' and password as value of 'Instance Id' to launch Rstudio.
