# Analyzing CMPD Traffic Stop

In this post, we'll examine a data set of stops by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD). 

Our focus will be to understand what factors are related to whether someone is searched or not for a traffic stop.

```{r load-packages-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Loading the libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(ggspatial)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(lubridate)
library(sf)
library(viridis)
library(ggridges)
library(gapminder)
library(forcats)
library(plotly)
df <- read_csv("Officer_Traffic_Stops.csv")
```

## Demographics of drivers

First, look at the data using the `glimpse()` function from `dplyr`

```{r glimpse}
glimpse(df) # Taking a glimpse at data
```

Notice the different variable types: character (chr), num (numeric), and datetime (POSIXct).

Let's consider our target variable: `Was_a_Search_Conducted`.

## How well balanced is the data set by this field?

A bar chart that counts the number of records by `Was_a_Search_Conducted`.

```{r bar}
plot.count <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Was_a_Search_Conducted)) + # X and Y axeses
  geom_bar(fill = "lightblue") + # Fill Color
  geom_text(aes(label=..count..),stat = "count", # Label and it's position
            position=position_stack(0.5)) 
plot.count
```

The data is heavily imbalanced. We have 65440 cases where search was not conducted where as there are only 3048 cases in which a search was conducted.

Next, let's consider the age range of the driver. 

## Plotting a histogram of `Driver_Age` and identifying the appropriate bin size


```{r histogram-bins-40}
plot.hist <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Driver_Age)) + # X and Y axeses
  geom_histogram(bins = 40) # Bin size
plot.hist
```


```{r histogram-bins-50}
plot.hist <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Driver_Age)) + # X and Y axeses
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) # Bin size
plot.hist
```

```{r histogram-bins-60}
plot.hist <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Driver_Age)) + # X and Y axeses
  geom_histogram(bins = 60) # Bin size
plot.hist
```

Appropriate number of bins can be 50, this bin size gives a better understanding of the distribution of the driver's age and number of stops.

The number of stops of drivers decreases as the age of the driver increases. There is a clear rise in count of stops at the the age of 21-30 years. This doesn't necessarily means that drivers from 21 to 30 are more prone for stops based on the plot because the splike can even be because that is the age where more number of drivers are present.

## A density plot of `Driver_Age`

```{r density}
plot.den <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Driver_Age)) + # X and Y axeses
  geom_density(fill = "lightblue") + # Fill color
  stat_density(adjust = 5, alpha = 0.5) # Adjust and transparency parameters
plot.den
```

## A box plot with `Was_a_Search_Conducted` on the x-axis and `Driver_Age` on the y-axis.

```{r boxplot}
plot.box <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Was_a_Search_Conducted, y=Driver_Age)) + geom_boxplot() # Box plot
plot.box
```

## A violin plot with `Was_a_Search_Conducted` on the x-axis and `Driver_Age` on the y-axis.

```{r violin}
plot.violin <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Was_a_Search_Conducted, y=Driver_Age)) + geom_violin() # Violin plot
plot.violin
```

From the above plots, it is very evident that the searches are conducted more for the drivers under the age of 30, mostly around 25.

## Let's plot the number of stops by time. 

Recalling part one, the `Month_of_Stop` variable is a character, not a date variable. The datatime's are simply when the data was collected; not when the stop occurred. Therefore, we'll need to convert the `Month_of_Stop` variable from a character to a Date format.

Let's first cleanup the date field using `tidyverse` packages like `stringr` and `lubridate`.

```{r date-cleanup}
# Had to do a workround to make the code working for '-' by splitting the statement to mutiple steps
df <- df %>% mutate(Month_of_Stop = str_replace_all(Month_of_Stop,"/","-")) # replace "/" with "-"
df <- df %>% mutate(Month_of_Stop = paste0(df$Month_of_Stop,"-01"))  # add in day
df <- df %>%  mutate(Date = ymd(df$Month_of_Stop)) # created a date field
head(df)
```

## A line chart with the number of traffic stops for each month 

```{r stops}
plot.line <- df %>% count(Date) %>% ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = n)) + geom_line() + #line plot
  geom_smooth(method = "auto") # trend line
plot.line

plot.line <- df %>% count(Date) %>% ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = n)) + geom_line() + #line plot
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") # trend line
plot.line
```

Tried using different models to see whether there a defined pattern. Based on the trend line, there isn't any stonng long term trend - number of traffic stops at charlotte is slightly going up. The data keeps fluctuating and gives more of a seasonality though it can't be attributed to a specific time of the year. 

## Analyze data for different `Reason_for_Stop`

```{r stops-by-reason}
plot.facet <- df %>% count(Date, Reason_for_Stop) %>% ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = n)) + geom_line() + # line plot
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +  # trend line
  facet_wrap(~Reason_for_Stop) # faceting 
plot.facet
?scale_x_date
```

## Is there a problem with the plot?

The plot is very difficult to interpret because of the common scale used across all the faceted plots. The data in each of these plots are at different ranges which is making the interpretation using a common scale difficult.

To address this problem, we need to adjust the scale. Setting "free_y"/"free_x"/"free" this makes the y/x/both axis independent. 

## Plot the same plot but with a free y-axis scale.

```{r stops-by-reason-2-free_y}
plot.facet2 <- df %>% count(Date, Reason_for_Stop) %>% ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = n)) + geom_line() + # line plot
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +  # trend line
  facet_wrap(~Reason_for_Stop, scales = "free_y") # faceting and free y axis
plot.facet2
```

```{r stops-by-reason-2-free_x}
plot.facet2 <- df %>% count(Date, Reason_for_Stop) %>% ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = n)) + geom_line() + # line plot
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +  # trend line
  facet_wrap(~Reason_for_Stop, scales = "free_x") # faceting and free x axis
plot.facet2
```

```{r stops-by-reason-2-free}
plot.facet2 <- df %>% count(Date, Reason_for_Stop) %>% ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = n)) + geom_line() + # line plot
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +  # trand line
  facet_wrap(~Reason_for_Stop, scales = "free") # faceting and free x and y axeses
plot.facet2
```

Based on the plots, speeding seems to be the most volatile one. The number of stops keep swinging back and forth almost every month.

Since the y-axis scale is not uniform, comparisons between the different 'Reason for Stop' is not straightforward. Though some of the plots shows heavy upward on downward trend, the change rate can't be really compared against another category because of the different scale.

Small multiples tends to be less effective when each of the variables are on different scales or magnitudes.

Let's consider instead CMPD traffic stops but by CMPD division. These are more even spread by division than the type of stop.

## Analyze stops by `Date` and `Count`

```{r stops-by-division}
plot.div <- df %>% count(Date, CMPD_Division) %>% ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = n)) + # no: of stops by division
  geom_line() + # line plot
  geom_smooth(method = "auto") +  # trend line
  facet_wrap(~CMPD_Division) # faceting and free y axis
plot.div

plot.div <- df %>% count(Date, CMPD_Division) %>% ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = n)) + # no: of stops by division
  geom_line() + # line plot
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +  # trend line
  facet_wrap(~CMPD_Division) # faceting and free y axis
plot.div
```

The number stops in North Tryon Division seems to have a very sudden spike in the beggining of 2017. North Division also shows the same behaviour. But overall trend in North Tryon Division is upward where as North Division is slightly trending low.

Number of stops in Metro Division and Freedom Division have been consistently low compared to other divisions

Number of stops in Western Division and South Division is having a higher rate of reduction when it comes to long term  trends.
